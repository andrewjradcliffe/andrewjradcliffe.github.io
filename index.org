** Greatest convex minorant / least concave majorant
Currently in [[file:gcm-algorithm.pdf][pre-pre-print]] stage, but the idea is crystallized.  More
will be added (e.g. online algorithm), but in order to get it on
=crates.io= sooner rather than later, while providing users a rigorous
foundation, I opt for release here.  This needs endorsement prior to
submission to =arXiv.org=. When that happens, the link will be updated
to point there.
